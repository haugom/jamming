### Jamming learning project

I am archiving this old training project.

---

I've been doing the steps in unit 3, jamming. I had to start think for myself when I started on the integration with spotify.

I did not deploy the app using the surge thing. I deployed it in a docker container instead here:

* I went a little freestyle with the Spotify module, not doing it exactly like the instructions.
* I tried to make a display screen to the user, explaining this is a training project etc and not redirecting instantly to spotify authorize api.
* I tried to implement a basic spinner when clicking the save playlist.

But my CSS skills are not that awesome.
